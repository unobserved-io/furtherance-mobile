# Furtherance for iOS & Android

This project is a work-in-progress. I'm hoping it will be finished in about a month. In the meantime, please check out [Furtherance for Windows, Mac, and Linux](https://github.com/unobserved-io/Furtherance) if you haven't already.

As you can see, I put many hours into Furtherance and give it away for free. If you'd like to see more, better, faster development, please consider leaving a tip. I truly love this work and my dream is to be able to make somewhat of a living from it.

## More Info

Furtherance for mobile is being created using the [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) framework, which allows me to use the existing backend code, minimizing the extra work I need to do and also allowing me to use pure Rust for both projects, which will reduce overhead while keeping performance excellent.
